# ## Readmission Dataset: Exploratory Data AnalysisÂ¶
#     Here, I will be analysing the Readmission dataset. This is a supervised classification dataset. 
#     Variables could be categorical or numerical. There are different statistical and visualization techniques of investigation for each type of variable.
#     Below are the questions that i will be addressing via exploratory analysis, which will give us more insight into the dataset:
#     What age range,gender, were most readmitted?
#     Does Weight contribute to readmission?
#     what factors helped reduce Readmission?
#     How does time in hospital relate to readmission?

# The table above describe all numerical variables.; Comparing mean and 50% percentile will give hint if data are skewed or not.

# >   The above table and graph shows how readmission increases as age increases,the graph also shows that more readmissions occurs between age 60 and 90.
# 
# >   Let's compare age frequencies accross all categories of readdmission variable, this will give us hint about relationship between age and readmission.

# >  Above new graph shows more insight, overall the frequency of 'NO' readmission is far more than  >30 & <30  days 
#     readmission frequencies.
#     
# >  Nevertheless, the graph shows that patients of age range 50 and 90 visits hospital/clinic more than other age ranges

# ## Does Weight contribute to readmission?
# >  By the way weight is already converted to categorical data type via binning, so i will be investigating how weight affect readmission
